<Note>
For guidance on diagnosing performance bottlenecks, please refer to the [relevant documentation](/best-practices/performance#performance-tips). 
Note that Ampere architecture cards (e.g., 3060, 3090, 3080 Ti) require CUDA 11.1 or higher, while Titan Xp, 1080 Ti, 2080 Ti, P40, and V100 have no such requirement. 
Use a higher - version framework.
</Note>

On the GPUhub platform, CPU and memory are allocated proportionally to the number of rented GPUs. The CPU and memory figures in the compute power market represent the amount allocated per GPU. For example, if you rent two GPUs, the CPU and memory will be doubled. Also, note that GPUs are not shared; each instance has exclusive access to its allocated GPU.

## CPU Selection

CPUs are crucial! Although CPUs don't directly participate in deep - learning model computations, they must provide data - processing capabilities exceeding the model - training throughput. For instance, an 8 - GPU NVIDIA V100 DGX server achieves 8,000 images/second training throughput with ResNet - 50 ImageNet classification. However, a 16 - GPU V100 DGX2 server fails to double this throughput, indicating the DGX2's CPU has become a performance bottleneck.

We typically allocate a set number of CPU logical cores per GPU. Ideally, model - computation throughput rises linearly with more GPUs, and the CPU - core allocation for one GPU can scale up linearly for multiple GPUs. GPUhub's instances offer various CPU - allocation specs. Each GPU should have at least 4 - 8 CPU cores for multi - threaded, asynchronous data reading. Adding more cores usually brings little gain, as data - reading bottlenecks often stem from Python's multi - process switching and data - communication overhead (e.g., with PyTorch DataLoader). To save costs and overcome this bottleneck, try NVIDIA DALI, a C++ - and CUDA - based data - reading acceleration library, on GPUhub. In our tests, a single - core CPU instance outperformed an eight - core Python - based one in data reading, effectively supporting model training.

GPUs in GPUhub machines are paired with high - performance CPUs, such as:

|GPU Model|CPU Models|
|----|----|
|H20-NVLink|AMD EPYC 9K84|
|4090|Xeon(R) Gold 6430|
|A100|AMD EPYC 7763|
|4090|Xeon(R) Platinum 8352V, 8358P, and Gold 6430|
|4090D|Xeon(R) Platinum 8474C and 8481C|
|4090/4090D|AMD EPYC 9654 and 9754|
|L20/H20-NVLink|Xeon(R) Platinum 8457C|

<Tip>
Server CPUs generally have lower clock speeds than desktop CPUs but more cores. When switching from a desktop CPU to a server CPU, you must fully utilize the multi-core performance; otherwise, you can't harness the server CPU's capabilities. Learn how to utilize this by checking the [relevant documentation](/best-practices/performance#performance-tips).

## GPU Selection

The platform offers a variety of GPU models, which can be categorized into five main architectures:

- **NVIDIA Pascal Architecture GPUs:** Such as TitanXp and GTX 10 series. These GPUs lack low - precision hardware acceleration but offer moderate single - precision compute power. Their affordability makes them ideal for training small models (e.g., Cifar10) or debugging model code.
- **NVIDIA Volta/Turing Architecture GPUs:** Such as GTX 20 series and Tesla V100. These GPUs feature TensorCores for low - precision (int8/float16) compute acceleration. However, their single - precision compute power hasn't improved much over the previous generation. We recommend enabling mixed - precision training in deep learning frameworks to accelerate model computation. Mixed - precision training can typically provide over twice the training speedup compared to single - precision training.
- **NVIDIA Ampere Architecture GPUs:** Such as GTX 30 series and Tesla A40/A100. These GPUs have third - generation TensorCores that support the TensorFloat32 format, which can directly accelerate single - precision training (enabled by default in PyTorch). However, we still suggest using the ultra - high - compute - power float16 half - precision training for models to achieve more significant performance improvements over previous - generation GPUs.
- **Cambricon MLU 200 Series Accelerator Cards:** These cards don't support model training. For model inference, computations need to be quantized to int8. Also, a deep learning framework adapted to Cambricon MLU must be installed.
- **Huawei Ascend Series Accelerator Cards:** These support both model training and inference. However, the MindSpore framework needs to be installed for computations.

Choosing a GPU model isn't difficult. For common deep learning models, the performance can be roughly estimated based on the GPU's compute power at the corresponding precision. The GPUhub platform labels and ranks the compute power of each GPU model, making it convenient for users to choose the right GPU.
The number of GPUs to select depends on the training task. Generally, a model should be trained within 24 hours to allow for iterative improvements the next day. Here are some suggestions for selecting multiple GPUs:

- **1 GPU:** Suitable for training tasks with smaller datasets, such as Pascal VOC.
- **2 GPUs:** Allows running two sets of parameters or increasing the Batchsize compared to a single GPU.
- **4 GPUs:** Suitable for training tasks with medium - sized datasets, such as MS COCO.
- **8 GPUs:** A classic and versatile configuration suitable for various training tasks and convenient for reproducing paper results.
- **More GPUs:** For training large - parameter models, extensive hyperparameter tuning, or ultra - fast model training.

## RAM Selection

Generally, sufficient memory doesn't impact performance. Yet, GPUhub instances have stricter memory limits than local computers (which use hard - disk virtual memory when memory is low, just slowing down speed). For example, if an instance has 64GB of memory and the program needs 64.1GB during training, the system will kill the process at the moment of exceeding the limit, interrupting the program. So, if you need more memory, choose a host with more memory or rent multiple - GPU instances. If unsure about memory usage, monitor it in the instance monitor.

  <Card title="Quick Start" icon="hat-wizard" href="https://www.autodl.com/">
    Register an account and easily create a Cloud Container Instance: Select the billing model, choose the appropriate host, select the number of GPUs for the instance you want to create, select the image (which includes different deep learning frameworks), and then create it.

  <Card title="GPU Selection" icon="cauldron" href="https://www.autodl.com/">
    Select the GPU suits your purpose and scenario: The platform allocates GPUs, CPUs, and memory proportionally to the number of GPUs rented. The CPU and memory displayed in the computing power market are allocated per GPU. If you rent two GPUs, the CPU and memory will be doubled.

title: 'System Disk Space Insufficient'
description: 'First, identify which directory is occupying the system disk space.'

If you are unsure what the system disk is, please refer to the help [documentation](/container-instance/overview).

You can check the usage of the system disk and data by running the command source `~/.bashrc`.

The following two directories can be directly deleted without affecting system operation, so **start by removing them**. If this does not free up space, proceed to the next steps:

```bash
du -sh /root/miniconda3/pkgs/ && rm -rf /root/miniconda3/pkgs/*      # Conda's historical packages
du -sh /root/.local/share/Trash && rm -rf /root/.local/share/Trash   # JupyterLab's trash
```

The following directories may occupy significant space, but you should clean them based on your specific situation:

```bash
du -sh /tmp/
du -sh /root/.cache
```

## Normal Cleanup Steps
### File Size
### Directory Size
### Deletion
### Special Folders Not Occupying System Disk Space

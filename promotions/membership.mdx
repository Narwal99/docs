## Membership Levels

Membership levels are determined by the growth points accumulated within the last 3 months. Once the growth points within 3 months meet the criteria, an automatic upgrade or downgrade will be triggered. The rules are as follows:

| Level                                   | Regular User                            | Membership User                                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Membership Conditions (Non-Student)** | Growth points in the last 3 months >= 0 | Growth points in the last 3 months >= 100                           |
| **Membership Conditions (Student)**     | --                                      | Students remain as Membership Users during the certification period |

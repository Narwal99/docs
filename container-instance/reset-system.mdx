description: 'Resetting the system or changing the image restores the instance to the initial state.'

<Note>
if a community or custom image is used, resetting returns the system to the image's original state, not deleting all data, so the system disk will still be occupied.

Resetting the system and changing the image will reset the data on the system disk (for what is a system disk, please refer to the [documentation](/container-instance/overview#about-system-disk)), while data on the data disk, cloud disk, and file storage will not be affected.

<Note>
For instances with Usage-based Billing Model that are already powered on, if you need to increase or decrease the number of GPUs, you can use the scale configuration feature to adjust the instance's settings. For instances with Subscription Billing Model, if you want to scale up or down, you will first need to switch to Usage-based Billing Model before adjusting the configuration.
</Note>

## Upgrade Configuration Tips

Go to Console -> Instances and click on the instance name in the first column to view the current host's GPU availability, which will help you determine if the host can support further configuration upgrades. If the available GPUs on the current host do not meet your upgrade requirements, you can choose to [migrate to another host]() that satisfies your needs.

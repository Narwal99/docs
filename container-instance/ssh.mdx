<Note>
Windows Users: You can log in using the built-in PowerShell/CMD. For a better terminal experience, it is recommended to download and use the [Cmder](https://cmder.app/) tool, which is ready to use without installation after extraction. Alternatively, the [XShell](https://www.xshell.com/en/free-for-home-school/) tool is an even better option.
</Note>

<Note>
Mac Users: You can complete the SSH login using the system's built-in Terminal.
</Note>

## SSH Authentication

After starting the instance, locate the SSH login command.

Copy your SSH login command, which in this demonstration is: ```ssh -p 10309 root@connect.nmb1.seetacloud.com```.

<Note>
In this command, the meanings of the parameters are as follows:

- Username: root
- Host: connect.nmb1.seetacloud.com
- Port Number: 10309
</Note>

Enter the command in your local terminal and enter your password to log in. *(Note: The password will not display any characters; press Enter after correctly typing or pasting with the ðŸ–° right-click of your mouse.)*

<Warning>
If you run a training program after logging in via SSH, use screen/tmux to start a daemon process to ensure that the program execution is not affected by SSH connection interruptions! For details on how to use screen, see the section on [Daemon Processes]().
</Warning>

## Passwordless Authentication

Access the SSH key login settings from **Console -> Instances** to set up your public key for password-free login.

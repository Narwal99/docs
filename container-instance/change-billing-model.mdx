1. Container instances allow for conversion between the **Usage-based Mode** and the **Subscription Mode**. 
2. The conversion option is accessible by clicking on "Switch to Usage-based" or "Switch to Subscription" under the "More" actions in the last column of the instance list.
3. Switching from a Subscription Mode to a Usage-based Mode will initiate a refund. 
    - The refund policy calculates the expenses incurred during the subscription period based on the duration of use. 
    - For example, if you subscribed for a month but utilized the instance service for 8 days (Duration over a week) before switching to a Usage-based Mode, the expense will be calculated at weekly pricing. The expense incurred would be:  Weekly Pricing * (8 / 7) .
4. Deductions of the incurred expense will prioritize the use of any paid coupons first. If the coupons do not fully cover the expense, the remaining amount will be deducted from the paid balance. Any unutilized balance will then be refunded.
5. Note that any remaining balance on the coupons after the deduction will not be refunded. 
6. Considering the refund policy, the **most economical usage approach** is to subscribe under the Subscription Mode and then switch to a Usage-based Mode for a refund if you cease to use the service, allowing for billing at a more cost-effective rate.

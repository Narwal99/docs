description: 'To reduce the cost of using instances and provide a more flexible experience, GPUhub adopts a shared bandwidth scheme for instances in the same region, instead of charging separately for network bandwidth and traffic.'

<Note>
The bandwidth for each region is approximately 1-2 Gbps, with equal upload and download speeds.
</Note>

During peak hours, if other users on the same host are pulling large datasets at the same time, it may further slow down shell responsiveness and file transfers.

This only affects SSH and uploads/downloads—not actual training speed.

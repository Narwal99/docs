<Note>
Please note that the port and other information in the SSH login command need to be replaced with the details corresponding to your instance.
</Note>

Copy the login command as follows (please adjust to match your instance): `ssh -p 44562 root@region-1.autodl.com`. 

Since XShell has a specific command format, you will need to manually modify the format to: `ssh root@region-1.autodl.com 44562`, which **places the port number at the end without the need for the `-p` parameter**.

## Common Issues
The models downloaded from HuggingFace take up a lot of system disk space, causing the system disk space to run out.

By default, HuggingFace caches models in the /root/.cache directory. You can save the model cache to the data disk by following these methods:

Execute in the terminal:

```bash bash
export HF_HOME=/root/gpuhub-tmp/cache/
```

Or execute in Python code:

```Python python
import os
os.environ['HF_HOME'] = '/root/gpuhub-tmp/cache/'
```

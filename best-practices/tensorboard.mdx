The instance on GPUhub comes pre-installed with the TensorBoard tool. You just need to save the TensorBoard event files to the /root/tf-logs/ directory (if you wish to use a different logs folder, see the section below on changing directories), or copy the event files saved in another path to this directory, and then use TensorBoard.

## Default Access Method
After powering on the instance, locate the access entry for AutoPanel:

## Switch TensorFlow Logs Directory

If you wish to use a different logs directory, you can manually start another instance of TensorBoard:
First, terminate the default TensorBoard process by executing the command:

```bash bash
ps -ef | grep tensorboard | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
```
Then, run the following command in the terminal to start TensorBoard:

```bash bash
tensorboard --port 6007 --logdir /path/to/your/tf-logs/directory
```
After starting, you can access TensorBoard again through AutoPanel.

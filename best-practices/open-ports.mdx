title: 'Open Ports'
description: 'Since our instances do not have a dedicated public IP, arbitrary ports cannot be opened directly.'

<Note>
Opening ports requires enterprise verification, which can be accessed through the "Console" → "Account" → "Account Security". If you are an individual user, you can choose to use an SSH tunnel tool to proxy any port to your local machine for access.
</Note>

As instances lack a public IP, direct port opening isn't possible. GPUhub provides public access to each instance's port `6006` via a mapped `ip:port`, supporting TCP or HTTP. You can find this `ip:port` via the 'Custom' portal.

After clicking to access, you can obtain the address, for example: `region-11.gpuhub.com:26040`. `region-11.gpuhub.com` and `26040` are the address and port, respectively.
For examples of using this feature, you can refer to [Visdom documentation](/best-practices/visdom#custom-service-method).

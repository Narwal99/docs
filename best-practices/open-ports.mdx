GPUhub provides public access to each instance's port `6006` via a mapped `ip:port`, supporting TCP or HTTP. You can find this `ip:port` via the 'Custom' portal.

After clicking to access, you can obtain the address, for example: `region-11.gpuhub.com:26040`. `region-11.gpuhub.com` and `26040` are the address and port, respectively.
For examples of using this feature, you can refer to [Visdom documentation](/best-practices/visdom#custom-service-method).

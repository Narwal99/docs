<Warning>
If you use VSCode to directly run or execute training programs in the terminal, make sure to [start a daemon process with tools like screen or tmux](/container-instance/run-in-background) after debugging is complete. This ensures that the program execution is not affected by SSH connection interruptions!
</Warning>

Work with GPUhub:

Before you start, you need to have VSCode installed. Additionally, you should:
1. **Rent and power on an instance** on GPUhub, and obtain the SSH login information for the instance (login command and password).
2. **Install the VSCode Remote Development extension** on your local machine (Remote-SSH configuration is required).

## 1. Log in to GPUhub and select the powered-on instance
Obtain SSH Login Information

## 2. Configure Remote-SSH in your local VSCode
If you have already installed the **Remote-SSH** extension in your local VSCode development tool, you can skip this step and proceed directly to [Step 3].

## 3. Establish an SSH connection and log in to your remotely rented instance

Click through as indicated in the illustration to complete adding an SSH host.

Login Command:

The illustration uses `ssh -p 38909 root@region-1.gpuhub.com` as an example. Press the Enter key to continue the operation. 

<Note>
If there is a "space" at the end of this ssh command, please remove it, otherwise you may not be able to log in.
</Note>

After pressing Enter, a prompt to customize the SSH config file may appear; you can **ignore it**. Simply press Enter again. 

You may soon be presented with options to select the remote server's operating system, whether it's Windows, Linux, or Mac. **Please choose Linux**.

Enter the password and wait for the SSH login to complete.

## 4. Select your code directory

The example code has already been uploaded to the instance's directory. If you haven't uploaded your resources yet, you can refer to the sections on [SCP for remote file](/data/upload-data#remote-copy-via-scp) copying or [JupyterLab](/data/upload-data#uploading-data-with-jupyterlab) to upload your code.

<Note>
Recommendation: When developing code in VSCode, you can configure the appropriate interpreter based on the programming language you are using.

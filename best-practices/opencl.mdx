If your program uses OpenCL and it fails to work properly after installing OpenCL, you can handle it in the following way:
First, check if the nvidia-opencl dynamic link library exists:

```bash bash
ldconfig -p | grep nvidia-opencl
```

If there is output, it means the library exists (if it does not exist, there is an issue with the system environment; please contact customer service). Then execute the following commands:
```bash bash
mkdir -p /etc/OpenCL/vendors
echo "libnvidia-opencl.so.1" > /etc/OpenCL/vendors/nvidia.icd
```
Finally, check again if OpenCL can be used normally. If it still cannot be used, please contact customer service.

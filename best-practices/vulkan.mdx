If you encounter issues with Vulkan (or other software that depends on Vulkan, such as omnigibson) where the GPU device cannot be found, you can resolve it with the following steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Write the ICD file">
    ```bash bash
    cat >> /etc/vulkan/icd.d/my_nvidia_icd.json <<EOF
    {
        "file_format_version" : "1.0.0",
        "ICD": {
            "library_path": "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libEGL_nvidia.so.0",
            "api_version" : "1.3.277"
        }
    }
    EOF
    ```
    In the `library_path` above, the library should only be `libEGL_nvidia`, not `libGLX_nvidia`. The reason is that the server does not have a desktop environment and operates in headless mode, which requires the former. 
    For details, you can refer to the [NVIDIA Documentation](https://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/535.183.01/README/installedcomponents.html).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Verification">
    Install necessary dependencies:

    ```bash bash
    apt update && apt install -y vulkan-tools libvulkan1 libsm6 libegl1
    ```
    Finally, execute vulkaninfo `--summary` to confirm:

    ```bash bash
    $ export VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/etc/vulkan/icd.d/my_nvidia_icd.json     # Explicitly specify the ICD file path
    $ vulkaninfo --summary
    ...

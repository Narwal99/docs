## I. Content of the Agreement

GPUhub conditionally provides the "Customized Service" feature to users who rent GPU instances on the platform. This feature allows users to establish services based on HTTP, FTP, TCP, and other protocols on port 6006 of their instances. GPUhub maps this port to a service accessible via "domain name + port number" for use and invocation by the user. The user has the need to use the aforementioned customized service.
Both parties acknowledge that the customized service provided by GPUhub is designed to facilitate GPU-based research and is intended for research purposes only.

## II. Rights and Responsibilities

The user commits to using the customized service provided by GPUhub solely for research purposes and exclusively by the user, without forwarding the customized service link to any third party.
The user must complete real-name authentication to use the customized service feature provided by GPUhub.
The user commits to never using the customized service provided by GPUhub in the following circumstances:
A. For any activities related to virtual currencies, including mining.
B. For any password cracking or decryption activities.
C. For generating pornographic, violent, or other illegal content using AI technology, including voice, text, images, or videos.
D. For establishing or renting dedicated lines (including VPNs) or other channels to conduct cross-border business activities.
The user understands that the customized service is an open internet-based service. Once activated, any individual, organization, or computer program may potentially access the content placed on the customized service by the user. Therefore, the user commits to the following:
A. If the user uses the customized service to store sensitive or private data that leads to a data leak, the user shall bear full responsibility.
B. If the user uses the customized service to store pornographic, violent, or other illegal digital materials that spread on the internet, the user shall bear full responsibility.
C. If the user uses the customized service to generate pornographic, violent, or other illegal digital materials using AI technology that spread on the internet, the user shall bear full responsibility.
D. If the user violates the above commitments and engages in illegal activities, the user shall bear all legal responsibilities.
GPUhub will actively utilize technical means to monitor the content exposed by the customized service and cooperate with relevant telecommunications regulatory and law enforcement departments in their monitoring efforts. Upon discovering any illegal or non-compliant content in the customized service, GPUhub will immediately suspend the user's account and terminate the customized service. This action will not be considered a violation of the GPUhub User Service Agreement. If suspicious illegal activities are detected, GPUhub has the right to report to the police and provide relevant data.

## III. Liability for Breach of Contract
If either the user or GPUhub violates the commitments in Article II of this agreement, it shall be deemed a breach of contract, and the breaching party shall bear the liability for breach of contract and compensate the non-breaching party for any losses incurred. If the user's activities using the customized service violate relevant national or regional laws and regulations or this agreement, and are discovered by GPUhub, or if the user's service (host, IP, domain) encounters the following issues, which are verified by GPUhub or ordered to be closed by relevant authorities, GPUhub has the right to suspend or terminate part or all of the services provided to the user. The user shall bear all losses suffered by GPUhub as a result. In case of suspension of services, GPUhub may choose to require the user to delete or modify inappropriate content, and resume services after the user has taken effective measures to eliminate the issues. The suspension period will be counted within the service period, and the user will not be exempt from service fees during this period:
(1) If there are programs or software that attack or hinder the normal work of others.
(2) If the user uses the host, IP, and domain to send spam emails (emails sent without the consent of the recipient).
(3) If there is dissemination of information that undermines social order or public security; dissemination of information that incites radical behavior, pornographic content, or the establishment of gambling or pornographic websites.
(4) If the user fails to provide network usage information (such as IP addresses, domains) as required by GPUhub, fails to fill in the information requested by GPUhub, or refuses to be inspected by GPUhub.
(5) If the user establishes or rents dedicated lines (including VPNs) or other channels to conduct cross-border business activities.
(6) If there are circumstances where national network regulatory authorities, security departments, or other government departments require suspension or closure, or other behaviors prohibited by laws, regulations, policies, or public morals.
If the user violates the commitments made in this agreement or the above terms, resulting in complaints or claims from third parties against GPUhub, GPUhub has the right to interrupt internet access services, or even terminate this agreement and demand compensation for all direct losses from the user. If the user's actions lead to administrative penalties for GPUhub, GPUhub has the right to terminate this agreement and demand that the user pay a penalty, which may be deducted from any remaining balance in the user's account. In addition, the user shall bear all other or additional losses suffered by GPUhub as a result.
If the user's illegal activities, such as writing, running, or using programs or software, cause network interruptions for GPUhub or prevent other users from using the cloud services normally, GPUhub has the right to interrupt internet access services or terminate this agreement. The user shall compensate GPUhub for all direct losses suffered as a result, which may be deducted from any remaining balance in the user's account. If the compensation is insufficient to cover GPUhub's losses, the user shall make up the difference.
By continuing to use the GPUhub platform and accessing the customized service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this supplementary agreement.

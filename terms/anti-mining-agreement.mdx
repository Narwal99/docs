GPUhub is primarily dedicated to serving educational and scientific research communities by providing powerful computing resources to facilitate learning, innovation, and discovery. Given the intensive nature of cryptocurrency mining activities, which can significantly strain computational infrastructure and detract from our mission to support academic and research endeavors, we have established this policy to prohibit the use of GPUhub resources for cryptocurrency mining.

## 1. Definitions
- Mining Activities: Refers to the use of computational resources to validate blockchain transactions and create new cryptocurrency units, including but not limited to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and ALEO etc.
- Computational Resources: Includes all processing, memory, storage, and network resources provided by GPUhub.

## 2. Prohibitions
- Users must not utilize any virtual machines, servers, container instances, or other forms of computational resources from GPUhub for mining activities.
- Users must ensure their resources do not contain programs, scripts, or software specifically designed for or capable of mining.
## 3. Monitoring and Account Management
- GPUhub reserves the right to monitor resource usage patterns to detect potential mining activities.
- Upon detection of suspected mining activities, GPUhub will immediately suspend related services for investigation.
- Users will be notified within 24 hours to explain any detected anomalies.
## 4. Responsibilities and Penalties
- Violation of this policy constitutes a breach of contract.
- GPUhub may take actions including but not limited to deleting content, restricting account privileges, permanent account suspension, and temporary balance freezes.
- A penalty fee equivalent to the total consumption amount of the instance used for mining will be charged, which may be deducted from the user's remaining balance.
- In cases of suspected criminal activity, GPUhub reserves the right to preserve digital content and transfer it to relevant authorities.
## 5. Compensation for Losses
- Users must compensate GPUhub for all direct and indirect losses incurred due to violations, including but not limited to commercial reputation damage, governance costs, third-party compensation, and legal fees.

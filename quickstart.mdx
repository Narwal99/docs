<Note>
In GPUhub instances, data (including environments) is saved even after shutdown. 
You needn't reconfigure or reupload data upon restart. However, instances will be released if shut down continuously for 15 days. 
For details, see [Instance Data Retention Policy](/data/overview).
</Note>

## Create an Instance
After registration, enter the console. Under My Instances, click "Launch Instance".

On the instance creating page, select billing method, region, GPU type and count. Then choose a suitable idle host and image (with basic Deep Learning frameworks or community images) to create the instance.

<Tip>
For larger data storage, check the expandable disk size. 
Refer to the [Instance Overview](container-instance/overview) for the data disk path.
</Tip>

After creation, wait for startup. The main operation entry points are in the item.

<Warning>
Note that billing starts when the instance status shows 'Running'. 
Shut it down promptly to stop billing when not in use. 
For billing rules, see [Billing Description](recharge-pricing/billing).
</Warning>

## Upload Data

Once the instance is running, find the "JupyterLab" shortcut tool and click to open it. 
Locate the upload button in the screenshot to upload data. 
For folder uploads or advanced methods, refer to the [Data Upload](data/upload-data) documentation.

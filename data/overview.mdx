<Warning>
The instance's system disk and data disk are generally local SSDs, with a small portion being cloud disks. 
Local data disks offer good performance but lack redundant copies. Due to the inherent lifespan of local disks, there is a probability of failure. 
Important data should be regularly backed up to [file storage](/data/file-storage) or local storage. 
GPUhub does not provide reliability guarantees or services for such local storage products.
</Warning>

## Data Retention in Instances

Data retention rules in instances:

1. Data remains intact during normal operation, shutdown, restart, and even after the expiration of annual or monthly subscription plans. However, instances are subject to a release cycle. An instance will be released if it **remains shut down continuously for 15 days**, and **all data within the instance will be cleared**.
2. Additionally, rented hosts have a lease expiration date. The typical lease period for a host ranges from 3 months to several years. **If a host is no longer available for rent, the instance will also be released when the host is taken offline** (the system will display a red countdown notice on the instance at least 7 days in advance, and you can enable instance expiration/release alerts on the console homepage). Therefore, please pay attention to the lease expiration date of the host and it is recommended to subscribe to instance release/expiration notifications on the console homepage.

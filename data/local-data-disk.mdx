<Warning>
The instance's system disk and data disk are generally local SSDs, with a small portion being cloud disks. 
Local data disks offer good performance but lack redundant copies. Due to the inherent lifespan of local disks, there is a probability of failure. 
Important data should be regularly backed up to [file storage](/data/file-storage) or local storage. 
GPUhub does not provide reliability guarantees or services for such local storage products.
</Warning>

## Instance Creation
When renting an instance, a data disk of 50-100 GB is provided for free. If you need to expand the disk, select a host that supports the required capacity during rental.

## Adjust Capacity
Resize operations, both expansion and reduction, are also available after renting.

<Warning>
Expanding the instance data disk requires restarting the instance for the changes to take effect.
</Warning>

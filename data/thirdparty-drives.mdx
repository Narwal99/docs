## rclone

<Note>
Best performance, ideal for global cloud drives
</Note>

What it is: The most popular command-line cloud storage tool worldwide, supports sync + mount as local disk.

**Official Docs**: https://rclone.org/docs/

Natively supported drives (no extra setup needed):

1. Google Drive
2. OneDrive (global + CenturyLink China)
3. Dropbox
4. Aliyun Drive
5. Amazon S3, Backblaze B2, Wasabi, Cloudflare R2, Tencent COS, and most object storages
6. WebDAV, FTP, SFTP, etc.

Best for: Users who want maximum speed and mainly use global drives.

<Warning>
Due to container security restrictions, rclone mount (mounting as a local disk) is not supported on GPUhub instances and will fail with permission errors.
</Warning>

**Recommended**: Use rclone for sync/copy (fully supported and fast):

```bash
# Download data
rclone copy xxxdrive:datasets/my_data ./data --progress

# Upload results
rclone copy ./outputs xxxdrive:results/my_run --progress
```

**Alternative**: Serve as WebDAV (access like a network drive):

```bash
rclone serve webdav xxxgdrive: --addr 0.0.0.0:8080 --vfs-cache-mode writes

# Then open http://your-instance-ip:8080 in JupyterLab or browser.
```

For most training tasks, automated copy/sync works best.

description: 'The following introduces various methods for downloading data from instances.'
---

1. <Icon icon="thumbs-up" iconType="solid" /> **[FileZilla Software:]()** Supports both files and folders, and allows for easy drag-and-drop uploading and downloading.
2. **[JupyterLab:](/container-instance/jupyterlab)** Can download files but not folders. The advantage is its simplicity and ease of use.
3. **SCP Command:** Supports both files and folders. Since it is executed via the command line, _it has a slightly higher learning curve_.

## FileZilla

Refer to the [documentation](/data/file-storage) for FileZilla.

## SCP Command

<Note>
The following commands need to be executed on your local machine to copy data to the instance, not within the instance itself.

If you are using Windows, the default Windows system does not come with an SSH client. We recommend downloading and using the [Cmder](https://cmder.app/) tool, which is portable and can be used directly after extraction without installation.
</Note>

Copy your SSH login command, which has the format: 

```bash bash
# 35394 is the port number, and region-1.gpuhub.com is the remote address.
# Please replace these with your instance's port and address.
ssh -p 35394 root@region-1.gpuhub.com
```
<Warning>
Note that the parameter in the following command is ```-rP```, not ```-rp```.
</Warning>

Then, the SCP command for remotely downloading files is:

```bash bash
# Note that this command needs to be executed on your local machine.
scp -rP 35394 root@region-1.gpuhub.com:/path/to/file_or_folder_in_instance <local_file_or_folder>
```

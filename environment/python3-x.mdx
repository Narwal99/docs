The platform's built-in images all use Python 3.8. If you need to use other versions like Python 3.6 or 3.7 (for example, TensorFlow 1.14 requires Python 3.6 or 3.7), you can create virtual environments with these versions using Miniconda.

```bash bash
# Create a virtual environment named "my-env" with Python version 3.7
conda create -n my-env python=3.7
# Update the environment variables in .bashrc
conda init bash && source /root/.bashrc
# Activate the created virtual environment: my-env
conda activate my-env
# Verify
python
```

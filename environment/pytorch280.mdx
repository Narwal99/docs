<Note>
When using RTX 5090 or RTX PRO 6000 (**Blackwell architecture**), please use the latest images and install PyTorch as follows.
</Note>

1. RTX 5090 and RTX PRO 6000 require CUDA ≥ 12.8 and PyTorch ≥ 2.7.1 to detect and use the GPU at all.
2. **ONLY PyTorch ≥ 2.8.0 nightly builds currently support** multi-GPU (DataParallel / DDP) on these cards.
3. Strongly recommended to install the [nightly version](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/#nightly-builds) yourself for now.

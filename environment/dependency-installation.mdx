title: 'Dependency Installation'
description: 'In GPUhub, all data, including installed dependencies, is retained after shutdown. There is no need to reinstall them upon restart.'
---

If you wish to reuse the dependency environment when renting other hosts, you can try to save all data on the system disk as an image. Please refer to the [documentation on saving and loading Images](/environment/image).

## Install Other Python Versions
All images come with Miniconda pre-installed.

```bash bash
# Create a virtual environment named my-env with Python version 3.7:
conda create -n my-env python=3.7
# Update the environment variables in .bashrc:
conda init bash && source /root/.bashrc
# Activate the created virtual environment my-env:
conda activate my-env
```

## Install Other Frameworks

```bash bash
# PyTorch: Find the appropriate version from Previous PyTorch Versions. For example:
conda install pytorch==1.9.0 torchvision==0.10.0 torchaudio==0.9.0 cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch -c conda-forge
# TensorFlow: Find the corresponding version link from Install TensorFlow with pip. For example:
pip install https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow_gpu-2.6.0-cp38-cp38-manylinux2010_x86_64.whl

```
## Install Python Dependencies

```bash bash
# Using pip: For example,
pip install opencv-python scipy numpy Pillow
# Using conda: For example,
conda install numpy
# Searching for package names:
pip search xxxx  
conda search xxxx
# Trick to view available versions if unsure: Write a random version number (e.g., 9.9), 
# and pip will list all available versions in the error message:
pip install xxx=9.9
```
## Install System Dependencies

```bash bash
# Example for installing zip:
apt-get update    # Only needs to be run once, not every time  
apt-get install -y zip
# Searching for package names:
apt-get update    # Only needs to be run once, not every time  
apt-cache search xxxxx
```

## Install CUDA and Other Dependencies
For the installation of CUDA and other software, please refer to the [documentation](/environment/cuda-cudnn).

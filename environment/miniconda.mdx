If you need to use other versions of CUDA or cuDNN, you can easily set up the required environment in just a few steps using Miniconda. We recommend **choosing the Miniconda image when creating an instance** (it does not come with any deep learning frameworks pre-installed, keeping the runtime environment clean and avoiding unnecessary issues).

The following example demonstrates how to use Conda to set up an environment for TensorFlow 1.15.0.

<Tip>
If you need to install the virtual environment on a data disk, please refer to the method described at the end of the document.

## Creating a Virtual Environment

```bash bash
conda create -n tf python=3.7           # Create a virtual environment named "tf"
conda init bash && source /root/.bashrc # Update the environment variables in bashrc
conda activate tf                       # Switch to the created virtual environment "tf"
```
## Installing Software Dependencies

Here is an example of installing TensorFlow 1.15.0.

```bash bash
# After switching to the Conda virtual environment
conda install tensorflow-gpu==1.15.0
# Conda will automatically resolve and install the required CUDA and cuDNN versions for TensorFlow 1.15.0
```

```python python
# Simple test using Python after installation
import tensorflow as tf
hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
sess = tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(log_device_placement=True))
print(sess.run(hello))
```
## Switching the Notebook Environment

How to Use the New Conda Environment in JupyterLab Notebook

```bash bash
# Create a new Conda virtual environment (skip if already created)
conda create -n tf python=3.7             # Create a virtual environment named "tf"
conda init bash && source /root/.bashrc   # Update the environment variables in bashrc

# Add the new Conda virtual environment to JupyterLab
conda activate tf                         # Switch to the created virtual environment "tf"
conda install ipykernel                    # Install ipykernel to enable kernel integration
ipython kernel install --user --name=tf   # Set up the kernel for the environment, with "tf" as the kernel name

```

After executing the above commands, if you create a new Notebook, you can select the Notebook named "tf".

## Clearing the Conda Virtual Environment

```bash bash
# Clear the installed environment
conda deactivate          # Exit the current (tf) environment and return to the base environment
conda remove -n tf --all  # Remove the tf environment
```
## Deleting Installation Packages and Cache

```bash bash
conda clean -y --all
```
## Installing the Virtual Environment to the Data Disk

Execute the following commands to set up the virtual environment installation path to `/root/guphub-tmp/conda/envs` and the package cache path to `/root/guphub-tmp/conda/pkgs`:

```bash bash
mkdir -p /root/gpuhub-tmp/conda/pkgs
conda config --add pkgs_dirs /root/gpuhub-tmp/conda/pkgs

mkdir -p /root/gpuhub-tmp/conda/envs
conda config --add envs_dirs /root/gpuhub-tmp/conda/envs
```
Verifying the Configuration

```bash bash
# Check if the configured paths are in the file content
cat /root/.condarc

```

Cancelling the Configuration for Installing Virtual Environment to the Data Disk

Edit the `/root/.condarc` file and delete the lines corresponding to the configured paths.

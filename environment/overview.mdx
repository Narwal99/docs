## Recommended Usage

1. **First, check if the platform's pre-installed images** include the required versions of PyTorch, TensorFlow, or other frameworks. If available, prioritize using the platform's built-in images.
2. If the platform does not have the desired framework versions, determine the required CUDA version for your framework. For example, PyTorch 1.9.0 requires CUDA 11.1. You can then select a platform image with Miniconda and CUDA 11.1 pre-installed. This allows you to install the required framework without the hassle of setting up cudatoolkit. (The pre-installed CUDA on the platform includes .h header files, which is more convenient if you need to compile code.)
3. If neither of the above conditions is met, you can choose any Miniconda image and install the required frameworks, CUDA, or even other Python versions after the instance is started.

description: 'This document explains how to save, load, and share custom images on GPUhub, allowing users to replicate and reuse their configured environments across different instances.'

<Note>
GPUhub currently does not support importing custom images.
</Note>

To reuse or save your configured environment for later, you can save it as an image. You can also share these images with others.

## Save Image

After shutting down an instance, you can save the entire system disk of that instance by clicking "Save Image" in the "More" menu. ([What system disk is?](/container-instance/overview))

View saved images in the "My Images" menu.

## Load Image

When creating a new instance or replacing the image of an existing instance, select the saved image you created to restore all the contents of the original instance's system disk.

## Share Image

After saving an image, you can click "Share" in the actions menu to share it with specific users.

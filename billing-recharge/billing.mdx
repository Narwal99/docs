## GPU Container Instances

GPUhub offers two billing models for container instance: **Pay-as-you-go** and **Subscription**.

### Pay-as-you-go Model (PAYG)
- **Billing Rules:**
    - **Charges start when the instance is turned on and stop when it is turned off.** The fee is calculated as Duration * Unit Price, with the duration measured in seconds and a minimum charge of USD0.01.
    - **Billing occurs hourly and at shutdown.** The fee covers the usage period, with precise measurement down to the second.
    - **Billing starts based on instance on/off time, not GPU usage.**
<Card>
- Advantages:
    - Flexibility: Supports configuration adjustments (upgrades/downgrades), data disk expansion, and instance migration.
    - Cost Control: Billing stops when the instance is turned off (data is retained).
</Card>
<Card>
- Disadvantages:
    - Higher Costs: More expensive compared to subscription plans.
    - No GPU Reservation: GPUs are not reserved after shutdown. If the host lacks available GPUs upon restart, you may need to wait or use alternative solutions (e.g., saving images, migrating instances, or using no-GPU mode).
</Card>
### Subscription Model (Prepaid)

- **Billing Rules:**
    - **Prepaid:** Pay in full at the time of rental.
    - **Supports daily, weekly, and monthly rentals.**
    - **Instance shutdown upon expiration** (data remains intact).
    - **Renewal options** include daily, weekly, and monthly plans. You can also switch to the pay-as-you-go model (see below for details).
<Card>
- Advantages:
    - GPU Reservation: GPUs are reserved even after shutdown, ensuring availability.
    - Cost Savings: More economical for long-term use.
</Card>
<Card>
- Disadvantages:
    - Less Flexibility: Not as flexible as the pay-as-you-go model.
</Card>

### Switching Billing Model

- **Conversion between pay-as-you-go and subscription models is supported.** If switching from subscription to pay-as-you-go, a refund is provided based on the following rules:
    - Calculate consumed fees during the subscription period, with the unit price determined by the duration used. For example, if you subscribed for a month but used it for only 8 days, the consumed amount is calculated based on the weekly price (since usage exceeded 7 days).
    - Refund Calculation: The consumed amount is deducted first using any available vouchers, followed by the balance. Any remaining balance is refunded. Note: Vouchers are not refunded if there is a remaining balance.
    - Most Economical Usage: Subscribe for a period, then switch to pay-as-you-go billing for a refund. This ensures more cost-effective pricing.


### GPU Pricing

**Pricing is subject to the current rates displayed on the GPUhub website.**

## Elastic Deployment

### Pay-As-You-Go Billing (Default)

1. **Billing Calculation**
    - Billing starts when the container is powered on and ends when it is powered off.
    - Total cost = Duration * Unit price
    - Duration = Power-off time - Power-on time (billed per second, minimum charge $0.01 USD)

2. **Deduction Package**
Fees are deducted twice:
    - Every hour on the hour (for the previous hour's usage)
    - Immediately when the container is shut down. Usage duration is calculated precisely to the **second**.

3. **Important Note**
    - Billing is triggered solely by **container started / shutdown time**, regardless of whether the GPU is actively being utilized.

### Duration Package Billing

**How Duration Packages Work**: After purchasing a Duration Package, the system will automatically consume hours from the remaining balance in the package during settlement.
If the remaining hours are insufficient, any excess usage will be billed at the default pay-as-you-go rate.

For Example:
<Card>
You create a Elastic Deployment and purchase the following Duration Packages: "RTX 5090 1-day package" & "RTX PRO 6000 1-day package"
</Card>

The workload is scheduled across RTX 5090, RTX PRO 6000, and RTX 4090 GPUs.
    1. When settling a container that used an RTX 5090, the system prioritizes the RTX 5090 Duration Package. (e.g., 1 hour used → 1 hour deducted from the RTX 5090 package, leaving 23 hours, then settlement for this period = $0)
    2. When settling a container that used an RTX 4090, since no RTX 4090 Duration Package was purchased, it will be billed according to the default pay-as-you-go rules.
    3. Containers using RTX PRO 6000 will consume the corresponding package in the same manner.


### Duration Package Refund Policy

Refund amount = Minimum of (Total amount paid - Consumed amount, Remaining balance from non-voucher payment methods)
(Any unused portion paid with vouchers or coupons will not be refunded)

Consumed amount calculation: Consumed amount = Used hours * Unit price of the corresponding GPU modelRules for calculating consumed value:
    - If used hours < 24 hours → Calculated at the pay-as-you-go hourly rate
    - If used hours ≥ 24 hours → Calculated at the daily package rate
    - If usage exceeds one week or one month, the weekly/monthly package rate applies accordingly (using the most favorable longer-duration pricing)

### Data Disk Expansion

- **Billing Unit Price:** Varies by host and is displayed on the platform.
- **Billing Rules:**
    - **Pay-as-you-go Instances:** Paid data disks are settled daily at midnight, regardless of instance status. To stop billing, reduce the disk size to the free tier or release the instance.
    - **Subscription Instances:** Paid data disks are included in the total fee and paid upfront. After expiration, billing follows the pay-as-you-go rules (daily settlement at midnight).
    - **Account Balance Insufficiency:** Data is retained to prioritize billing. 
        - If the account owes more than USD50, the platform reserves the right to clean data (with caution). 
        - If overcharged due to delayed data cleanup, we will cover the excess with vouchers (e.g., if you owe USD60, contact support for a USD10 voucher; if you owe USD20, the user is responsible).

## File Storage

- **Elastic billing based on actual usage.** Free up to 20GB.
- **Billing Unit Price:** USD0.002/GB/day.
- **Billing Rules:**
    - **Charged based on the maximum daily usage,** excluding the free 20GB. Fees are deducted daily at midnight.
    - **Minimum Fee:** USD0.01 if exceeding the free capacity.
    - **Account Balance Insufficiency:** Data is retained to prioritize billing. 
        - If the account owes more than USD50, the platform reserves the right to clean data (with caution). 
        - If overcharged due to delayed data cleanup, we will cover the excess with vouchers (e.g., if you owe USD60, contact support for a USD10 voucher; if you owe USD20, the user is responsible).
- **Total Storage Capacity:** Default 200GB per user. Contact support for larger capacity.
<Card>
- Example: If the maximum daily usage is 50GB, the daily fee = (50 - 20) * 0.002 = USD0.60.
</Card>

## Images

- **Default Limit:** 20 images per user. Contact support for more.
- **Billing Unit Price:** USD 0.002/GB/day.
- **Billing Rules:**

<Card>
- Example: If the maximum daily usage is 50GB, the daily fee = (50 - 30) * 0.002 = USD0.40.

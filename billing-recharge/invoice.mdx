<Warning>
The amount that has been invoiced DOES NOT SUPPORT withdrawal.
</Warning>

We offer two invoicing methods: 

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="1. Based on Bill Amount" icon="file-invoice-dollar">
    The amount of your order that has already been consumed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="2. Based on Recharge Amount" icon="credit-card">
    The amount that has been successfully paid online through recharge.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The differences between them are as follows:

<Warning>
Recharge invoicing WON'T PROVIDE DETAILED invoice of billing later. 
</Warning>

1. **Different invoicing amount logic.** When invoicing based on consumption bills, the invoicing amount is the total amount of the selected consumption bills and cannot be freely adjusted. When invoicing based on recharges, you can issue an invoice immediately after recharging and customize the invoicing amount (with a minimum of USD10 per invoice).
2. **Different proof of consumption.** When invoicing based on recharge amounts, an invoice and recharge proof will be provided. When invoicing based on bill amounts, the detailed bills you selected at the time of invoicing will be provided.

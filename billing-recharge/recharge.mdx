## Online Payment

> Bank Card Payment (Supports Credit & Debit Cards)

After the online payment is successful, you can apply for invoices based on [order bill amount](/billing-recharge/invoice) or [recharge amount](/billing-recharge/invoice) through the console.

### Credit Points

After a customer signs an offline payment agreement with GPUhub, the actual funds may take several business days to arrive. To prevent any service interruption, GPUhub may grant the customer a temporary credit facility (“Credit Points”) that can be drawn down before the payment settles.

1. Granting

GPUhub assigns Credit Points to the customer's designated account at its sole discretion once the partnership is confirmed.

2. Use

The customer converts Credit Points into cash balance on demand (self-initiated “withdrawal”).

- Each Point converted becomes normal cash balance immediately.
- The cash balance is used automatically to pay service invoices.

3. Repayment

Once your offline payment arrives, GPUhub will help you complete the credit repayment by automatically offsetting the outstanding converted amount in the background; any unused Credit Points stay available until they expire or are revoked.

4. Responsibility

The customer must monitor usage and ensure sufficient Credit Points are available. GPUhub reserves the right to suspend services if the converted balance is exhausted and no further payment is received.

Due to the inevitability of hardware failures and other unforeseen circumstances, certain incidents may occur. 

<Warning>
We strongly recommend that users regularly back up important data to prevent potential losses. For further assistance, please contact our customer support team.
</Warning>

## Instance Downtime
- Confirmation Criteria: The instance status is "Shutdown - Unexpected Downtime."
- Handling: Users are advised to back up important data regularly. 

## Network Failure
- Confirmation Criteria: Network anomalies in the instance (not caused by local user-to-instance connection issues, such as using a VPN).
- Handling: Users are advised to back up important data regularly. 

## Local Disk Failure
- The system disk and data disk (/root/gpuhub-tmp) provided by GPUhub are local disks on the host. While local disks offer better performance, they lack redundant backups and may experience disk failures. 
- We strongly recommend that users regularly back up important data to prevent potential losses.

## Other Scenarios
The following scenarios are not eligible for compensation:
1. The instance status is normal ("Running"), but the program exits prematurely due to reasons such as not running in the background.
2. GPU memory not being correctly released due to driver issues, which can be resolved without restarting the instance.
3. System dependency errors caused by user actions, resulting in inaccessible services like JupyterLab. These can be resolved by resetting the system.
4. Etc.

## Contacting Support
